# Heart Disease Prediction Hackathon

## 🎯 Objective
Predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease (1 = Disease, 0 = No disease) based on clinical features.

You are provided with:
- `train.csv` → contains 14 features + target `Heart_Disease`
- `test.csv` → same features, but without target
- `sample_submission.csv` → format for final submission

Your task:
Build an ML model (any algorithm: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Neural Network) to predict the probability of heart disease.
